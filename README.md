# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
I created an app that allows two selection of messages being affirmations and mantras. By selecting an option you will be then given a phrase specific to your selection. If you receive a message you don't like, you can then click the delete message button that populates at the bottom of the screen and then receive another message. This solves the problem of coming up with your own affirmation or mantra (if you'd prefer that). By allowing a user to pick their own options, it will free them of the need to create their own mantras or affirmations.

### Installation Instructions:
You would go to gitHub and find https://github.com/tdmburr then the repository self-care-center. Select the green code button and select SSH. Then the box button to the right of the url. You would then access your terminal and type git clone to clone it to your machine. You would then cd (change directory) into self-care-center. Then open your code editor and access the page using index.html.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Learning Goals:

Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
Individualize your programming skill set

I worked with vs code, the terminal, github, HTML/CSS/Javascript

### Wins + Challenges:
I felt like writing (even basic) HTML was a win.
Connecting all of the pieces together and working with CSS to align and stylize the DOM was gratifying.
Further developing understanding of each line of code and what it does is another win.
